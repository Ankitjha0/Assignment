    "1. Mean:\n",
    "The mean is a measure of central tendency that calculates the average value of a dataset. Outliers can heavily influence the mean because they can pull the average towards extreme values.

In this dataset, the age of 100 is an outlier that significantly deviates from the other values.

In this dataset, the score of 105 and 110 are outliers that deviate significantly from the other scores. When calculating the standard deviation, these outliers will contribute to a larger spread in the data, resulting in a higher value than if they were not present. The standard deviation may overestimate the amount of variation in the exam scores due to the influence of the outliers."
