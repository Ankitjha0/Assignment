    "Exception - An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program , which disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.\n",
    "when an exception occurs the normal flow of the program is interupted , and the program jump to a special code block called an exception handler or an exception block, which is designed to handle the exceptional situation and prevent the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Occurrence: Exceptions occur during the runtime of a program when a specific error condition is encountered, while syntax errors are detected during the parsing phase, before the code is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nature: Exceptions are typically caused by unexpected situations or errors that occur during the execution of a program, such as division by zero, trying to access an index out of bounds, or opening a file that doesn't exist. Syntax errors, on the other hand, are caused by mistakes in the syntax of the code, such as misspelled keywords or missing punctuation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling: Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to gracefully recover from the error and continue executing the remaining code. Syntax errors, however, must be fixed before the code can be successfully executed, as they prevent the code from being parsed and interpreted correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection: Exceptions are typically raised by Python built-in functions or by user-defined functions using the raise statement. Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase and are usually highlighted with an error message indicating the line number and the nature of the syntax error."
